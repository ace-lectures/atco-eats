=== First Meeting with Client (Minutes)

Date: August 1, 2023

Attendees: The Phoenix Management, Project Team Members

Agenda: Requirements Gathering for Food Ordering App - *{project-title}*

Meeting started at 02:15PM.

Meeting Summary:

On August 1, 2023, The Phoenix Management and the project team members convened for the first meeting to discuss the requirements for the development of the "ATCO Eats" food ordering app.

The Phoenix Management conveyed their vision for a user-friendly and efficient app that would provide a seamless food ordering experience for their restaurant. **{project-title}** innovation is its **Smart Menu Recommendation System**. Unlike traditional food ordering apps, **{project-title}** employs advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze customer preferences, order history, and even real-time data, enabling it to make personalized menu recommendations for each user. This feature sets the app apart from its competitors, creating a more engaging and delightful ordering process that keeps customers coming back for more.

Key requirements highlighted during the meeting include:

1. *Real-time Order Tracking*: The Phoenix emphasized the importance of offering customers real-time order tracking to enable them to monitor their food delivery status accurately.

2. *Personalized Recommendations*: The management expressed interest in incorporating personalized menu recommendations based on customers' previous orders and preferences.

3. *User Interface and Navigation*: The Phoenix emphasized the significance of an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that simplifies navigation and enhances the overall app experience.

4. *Loyalty Program Integration*: The management desires to implement a loyalty program in the app, providing customers with rewards, discounts, and exclusive offers to foster customer retention.

5. *Menu Customization*: The Phoenix wishes to enable users to customize their orders, allowing them to tailor menu items according to their taste and dietary requirements.

6. *Notification System*: The management intends to implement a notification system to inform users of special deals, limited-time offers, and new menu additions.

7. *Payment Methods*: The Phoenix aims to offer various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, mobile wallets, and cash on delivery, to accommodate user preferences.

8. *Additional Features*: The management expressed openness to additional features that enhance user engagement and app functionality, such as feedback submission and in-app help.

The project team diligently recorded all requirements and addressed various queries raised by The Phoenix. Both parties acknowledged the importance of data privacy and security, regulatory compliance, and seamless integration with existing systems.

More specifically, the following key elements were listed in terms of operational concerns:

1. **Network Connectivity**: The app heavily relies on network connectivity to function properly. Operational constraints may arise in areas with poor or unreliable internet access, leading to potential difficulties in placing orders or tracking delivery status.
2. **Payment Processing**: The app's secure payment processing system relies on external payment gateways. Operational constraints may occur if there are issues with these payment providers, causing payment delays or failures.
3. **Server Capacity**: The app's server infrastructure needs to handle high traffic during peak hours, especially during weekends or special events. Insufficient server capacity may result in slow response times or even system crashes.
4. **Device Compatibility**: **{project-title}** needs to support a wide range of devices, including various smartphones and operating systems. Ensuring compatibility across different devices can be challenging and might lead to operational constraints if not adequately addressed.
5. **Data Security and Privacy**: The app handles sensitive customer information, including payment details and personal data. Strict adherence to data security and privacy regulations is essential to avoid potential breaches or legal complications. Failure to maintain robust security measures could lead to significant operational constraints and reputational damage.


Next Steps:

The project team will consolidate the gathered requirements and prepare a comprehensive document for review and validation by The Phoenix. *A follow-up meeting is scheduled for December 6, 2023 to present the finalized requirements and initiate the app development phase*.

Adjournment:

With a shared sense of enthusiasm and commitment, the meeting concluded on a positive note, reflecting the dedication of The Phoenix and the project team towards creating a successful *{project-title}* food ordering app.

Meeting adjourned at 04:30PM.

=== Response from ACME to The Phoenix

Subject: Request for Ideation Workshop

Dear Phoenix Management Team,

We've identified some initial similarities between *{project-title}* and existing platforms like Uber Eats. To ensure that *{project-title}* is tailor-made for your needs and stands out in the market, we propose an ideation workshop. This session will allow us to collaboratively brainstorm and refine the project's direction to meet your unique requirements effectively.

Your participation in this workshop would be invaluable in shaping the project's path. Please let us know your availability, and we will arrange a suitable time for the session.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

=== Ideation Workshop Report

Date: August 15, 2023
Location: ACME Inc. HQ

Participants:

- The Phoenix Management
- ACME Project Team Members


During the ideation workshop, The Phoenix and the ACME Requirements Engineering Team engaged in collaborative discussions to refine the project's direction and identify features.

The Phoenix quickly agreed that their initial description of *{project-title}* was similar to systems like DoorDash or Uber Eat and, as such, might not be the product they had initially envisioned.

As a result of the ideation discussion, The Phoenix identified a new list of priorities for *{project-title}*, which replaces the initial ones.

- **Integration into Campus**: *{project-title}* must leverage that The Phoenix is located at the heart of McMaster's historic campus. They are envisioning an integration between *{project-title}* and system like _Mosaic_ to allow McMaster's staff to order food for events directly through their internal information system and automatically support billing (instead of staff paying with their credit card and then submitting an expense report). 

- **Integration with Campus life**: *{project-title}* needs to reflect the campus life, _i.e._, support students when they need it the most (e.g., exam periods) or during their daily routine (e.g., short lunch break). The Phoenix envisions a pick-up mechanism where students can order meal boxes in advance and pick them up quickly at the restaurant. 

- **Attracting new customers**: *{project-title}* is also a way to expand their patron's pool. A loyalty card can bring people on campus and enjoy the patio, especially during summer times. The Phoneix envisions a loyalty card with points that can be accumulated and used to get some appetizers.

During the meeting, The Phoenix management team mentioned several times that University by-laws regulate campus life and that *{project-title}* will have to be compliant with these by-laws.
