ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Properties of the environment that may be assumed, with the goal of facilitating the project and simplifying the system. It defines properties that are not imposed by the environment (like those in <<e3>>) but assumed to hold, as an explicit decision meant to facilitate the system's construction._  <<BM22>>

Some assumptions made can be found below:

* **Operating system support**: We assume that we will have to support mobile operating systems that are still supported by mobile companies (iOS 15 and Android 11 at the time of writing).

* ** Internet browser support**: We assume that we only need to support three major internet browsers (Edge, Chrome, Safari).
