Prioritization of requirements were performed based on two key metrics; security and usability. All requirements that could affect the security of the app, the privacy of the users, or compliance with legal or standardized policies were determined to be high priority requirements. All requirements directly affected the goals of the application were also determined to be high priority. All requirements that had some affect on the goals of the application, but did not equate to the goal failing were determined as medium requirements. All requirements that had little to no affect on the goals of the application and were deemed as 'nice to have' features were determined to be low priority requirements.

Security and privacy had a high impact in how we determined our requirements as we wanted to make sure that our users were safe while using the app. Since there is a lot of highly sensitive information that can be held from this app (credit card information, student account information) it can be a prime target for malicious actors to attempt to gain access to user information. Therefore in order to ensure that all customers are safe we made all security requirements high priority requirements such that the design will also reflect this philosophy.
