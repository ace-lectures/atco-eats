=== (S.3) Interfaces

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _How the system makes the functionality of <<s2>> available to the rest of the world, particularly user interfaces and program interfaces (APIs). It specifies how that functionality will be made available to the rest of the world, including people (users) and other systems. These are interfaces provided by the system to the outside; the other way around, interfaces from other systems, which the system may use, are specified in <<e2>>._  <<BM22>>

==== (S.3.1) APIs

The *{project-title}* system only offers one API to the external world: `PendingInvoice`. This interface is used to integrate the system with <<mosaic>>, which will regularly pull pending invoices and start payment processing.

.External API exposed by {project-title}

- The interface exposes one single operation, to `list` the pending invoices.
- The system shall receive a single argument, being an authentication token which grants access to the system
- The system shall answer with all catering orders with `payed?` attribute being `false` and `status` being `DELIVERED`.

==== (S.3.2) Wireframe Mockups

We focus here on the two parts of the system that differs the most from "classical" food ordering systems such as DoorDash or Uber Eats.

===== (S.3.2.1) Impeding Orders (Line Cook)

The Line Cook stakeholder (<<dylan>>) needs to have quick access to the next batch of mealboxes to prepare (to ensure good quality of freshly prepared food). As they are working in a kitchen, they cannot rely on classical "tablet-like" interfaces that would requires clean hands. As such, they need to interact with a _Flush!_ physical push button located in the kitchen that automaticallt update the status of the ordered food on their behalf.

===== (S.3.2.2) Submit Catering Invoice (Restaurant Manager)

The Restaurant Manager fills out all the information provided by the Administrative Assistant using traditional means (_e.g._, phone, email). Then, they submit the invoice on their side, and wait for the payment to be processed by <<mosaic>>. The interface shall allow the restaurant manager (<<drew>>) to submit the information expected by McMaster's accountant to process the invoice (see the domain model, <<e1>>) .
