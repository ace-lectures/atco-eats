ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Specification of the conditions under which an implementation will be deemed satisfactory. Here, "verification" as shorthand for what is more explicitly called "Verification & Validation" (V&V), covering several levels of testing — module testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing — as well as other techniques such as static analysis and, when applicable, program proving._  <<BM22>>
