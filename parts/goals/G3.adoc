TIP: _New processes, or improvement to existing processes, made possible by the project’s results. It presents the business benefits expected from the successful execution of the project. **This chapter is the core of the Goals book**, describing what the organization expects from the system. It ensures that the project remains focused: if at some stage it gets pushed in different directions, with “creeping featurism” threatening its integrity, a reminder about the original business goals stated in those chapters will help._  <<BM22>>
