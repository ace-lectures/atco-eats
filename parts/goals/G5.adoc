=== (G.5) High-level usage scenarios

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Fundamental usage paths through the system. It presents the main scenarios (use cases) that the system should cover. The scenarios chosen for appearing here, in the Goals book, should only be the **main usage patterns**, without details such as special and erroneous cases; they should be stated in user terms only, independently of the system's structure. Detailed usage scenarios, taking into account system details and special cases, will appear in the System book (<<s4>>)._  <<BM22>>

.High Level use cases diagram

The use case diagram above highlights how we anticipate our direct stakeholders will interact with the app. More details for these usages are as follows:

* *Order food.* We expect customers to be able to order food directly from the app.

* *Food ready alert.* Once the food is ready we need to alert customers that they can get the food (either for pickup or in person).

* *Pay for food.* Provide option to pay for food through the app. This will also include the option to use the loyalty program as a means of payment.

* *Process payment for catering.* Allow catering customers to process they're payment directly using the app rather than current processes of expensing and reimbursement.

* *Sequence of food orders.* Need to sequence the food orders in a first-in first-out sequence for the line cooks.

* *Cook food complete.* Once the food is complete, line cook needs to remove order from the sequence to trigger alert and prevent repetition of cooking.

* *Check sales reports.* Restaurant manager wants to improve sales for the Firebird. Need to have a means of checking sales in app to determine progress of reaching that goal.
