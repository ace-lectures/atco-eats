_The Firebird_ operates as a classical restaurant on campus. Events are organized to attract grad students, and a patio was added for outdoor seating in the 90's to increase seat capacity during summer months. Often desribed as Hamilton's hidden jewel, its location does not help to attract external patrons (_e.g._, no parking). Local patrons would consider it as any restaurant in the area: for example, staff cannot order catering for events through <<mosaic>>, and have to consider it as any other invoice.
