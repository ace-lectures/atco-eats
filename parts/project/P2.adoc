=== (P.2) Imposed technical choices

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Any a priori choices binding the project to specific tools, hardware, languages or other technical parameters. Not all technical choices in projects derive from a pure technical analysis; some result from company policies. While some project members may dislike non-strictly-technical decisions, they are a fact of project life and must be documented, in particular for the benefit of one of the quality factors for requirements: "requirements must be justified"._  <<BM22>>
